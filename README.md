# Next.js Personal Website Theme

This is a custom personal website theme built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [
`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It’s designed as a minimal,
performance-focused starting point for showcasing your **work**, **writing**, and **projects**.

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

The site is organized around the following main pages:

- 🏠 **Home** – `/`
- 💼 **Work** – `/work`
- 🛠️ **Projects** – `/projects`
- ✍️ **Blog** – `/blog`

Each page is intentionally simple and clean, making it easy to customize and build upon.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This version does **not yet** support:
>
> - Light/Dark theme toggle
> - MDX-powered content for individual Work, Blog, and Project pages
>
> These features are on the roadmap and coming soon!

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start your development environment locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You can begin editing the homepage by modifying the file at:

```txt
app/page.tsx
```

The project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to
load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern, legible typeface by Vercel.
